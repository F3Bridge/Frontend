# FAQ

### Why not decentralize the registry?

In theory, we could decentralize the Discord profile to Lens profile mapping. For example by enabling users to publish the hash of their Discord username into their Lens profile and then searching for matching profiles on-chain.

However, it would be hard to independently verify the claim that they indeed own that Discord profile, and are not impersonating another user. Therefore, we use a trusted registry that verifies Discord and web3 ownership at the same time.

Transitioning from web2 to web3 inevitably will require some centralized registries, but the good news is that once you and your friends and communities are set up on Web3, you can from then on fully determine what you publish, what you want to consume and/or moderate, without any risks of being deplatformed or monetized without your explicit permission.
